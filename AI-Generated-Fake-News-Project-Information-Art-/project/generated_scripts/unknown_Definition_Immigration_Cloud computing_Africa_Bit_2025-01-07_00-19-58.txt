**Title: "Clouds Over Africa"**

**Shot 1: Definition**  
*INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM - NIGHT*  
A lone figure, OLIVIA, sits at a cluttered desk, illuminated by the glow of her laptop. Papers with definitions of "immigration," "cloud computing," and "Africa" are scattered around her. Her eyes flicker with determination. She types the final words of her thesis: "A new definition of home." The camera zooms in on her screen, highlighting the words. A cloud icon appears, swirling into the air, hinting at the digital world she’s connecting to.

*EXT. BUSY AFRICAN MARKET - DAY*  
Vibrant colors and sounds fill the air. People bustle, each carrying their stories. OLIVIA walks through, absorbing the energy, her laptop in hand. She stops at a stall, where a WOMAN sells handmade crafts. Their eyes meet, and a silent understanding forms. OLIVIA shows the woman her laptop, displaying her research on immigration. The woman nods, a smile breaking across her face, as they share a moment of hope amidst chaos.

*EXT. ROOFTOP IN AFRICA - SUNSET*  
The sky is ablaze with orange and purple hues. OLIVIA stands on the rooftop, her laptop open, connected to the vast digital expanse—cloud computing. Below, the city pulses with life. She uploads her thesis, the data transforming into bits of light that ascend into the sky, merging with the clouds. A VOICEOVER echoes: “In every byte, a journey; in every cloud, a home.” The camera pans out, revealing the city as the clouds drift, symbolizing connection and belonging.
